# maya-kaqchikel
My project is about making it easy to practice mayan kaqchikel language
Mayan languages, in Guatemala, do usually have a common set of syntactic rules.
I learned about mayan kekchi language at the University.
This year 2019 I am commanded to teach mayan kaqchikel, therefore I need to boost my approach to this interesting language.
This is why I chose Python as an idoneus programming language to accomplish the task of making easier my vision on kaqchikel.
This will be a dual learning experience so far.
Thanks for using this material.
You are welcome to improve all of my products.
